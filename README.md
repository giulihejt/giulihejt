<p> Welcome, adoring fan. It's great to see that my talents are finally being recognized. </p>

## A little bit about me...
<p> My name is Giuliana, but you can call me Giuli [joo-lee]. </p> 
<p> I've had an interest in programming since I was a wee lad. However, I'm a bit of a bum and have never taken my knowledge past basic HMTL/CSS - which I learned so that I could customize my Neopets profile, when I was 7.</p> 
<p> Due to the circumstances of life, I wasn't able to pursue a higher edcuation (although, I wanted to). I've made it out fine, but never pursued my passions. </p>

## ...Why am I here then?
<p> In 2024, AI hit a major breakthrough. Now (at the time of writing), it's Jan 2025 and we're approaching AGI (which some say have already achieved), and soon, ASI. Some say we're soon to pass the singularity... Eh, who knows? </p>
<p> Russia is at war with Ukraine. Isreal is "at war" with "Hamas" (not much of a war - they are obliterating them, along with countless Palestinian civillians). South Korea enacted martial law and, soon after, impeached their president. There is a lot of tension with the US and China. There is a lot of tension in the <i>world</i>. </p>
<p> With AI's rapid proliferation and rising global tensions, I'm feeling urgency to finally begin my CS journey, with an emphasis on cybersecurity. </p>
<p> And so, here I am. </p>

## My goals

>"Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, youâ€™ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- youâ€™ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything?"

<p> â€” Joseph Cirkiel, <i>the Dream Kid himself.</i> </p>


| Rank | Goal |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1|I'd like to reclaim my privacy.|
|     2|I'd like to learn a <i>real</i> programming language. (*sobs internally*)|
|     3|Then, I'd like to build something for myself. I just don't know what, yet. <p>(I've considered a local smart-home system, but not sure how viable that is for someone like me)</p>|

## Signing Off
<p> Thanks for reading my page, internet stranger and/or person I know that has randomly learned that I have a GitHub account and became curious. (you silly little stalker, you) </p>
<p> If you want to message me - do it. If you found my page, we have something in common and I could use some like-minded buddies. :relieved: </p>
